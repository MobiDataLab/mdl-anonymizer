## Install
To install the package, run the commands below in a terminal located at the root of this repository.
This will create a <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/">Conda</a> environment, install the dependencies and setup the module.
Setup is only required when using the module as a library in Python code, not for CLI usage (see [Usage section](#usage)).
```bash

# Create and activate environment
conda create -n mdl_env pip python=3.9 rtree
conda activate mda_env

# Install dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-mobility -y   # If this fails, use "pip install scikit-mobility"
conda install -c conda-forge pyarrow -y
conda install -c conda-forge py-xgboost
conda install -c conda-forge haversine -y
conda install tqdm typer more-itertools -y

# [Optional] API
conda install -c conda-forge fastapi
conda install -c conda-forge uvicorn
conda install -c conda-forge python-multipart


# [Optional] Build and setup the package for Python import, not required for CLI usage
conda install conda-build
conda develop mob_data_anonymizer
```

Tested to work with the following software versions:
* Python: 3.9 and 3.10
* Conda: 4.11.0 and 4.12.0
* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10

## Usage
This module can be used as an independent command line interface (CLI) tool or as a Python library.
Following subsections illustrate their usage.

### CLI
The developed package provides a command line interface (CLI) that lets users anonymize a mobility dataset and compute some utility measures over both the original and the anonymized datasets in a straightforward way.
```bash
python -m mob_data_anonymizer
```

#### Anonymization methods
The parameter values to configure the anonymization methods are provided to the application using a JSON file:  
```bash
python -m mob_data_anonymizer anonymize -f parameters_file.json
```
There are some common parameters to all the anonymization methods:
* method (string): The name of the anonymization method to be executed. Must be one of the following:
  * SwapMob
  * Microaggregation
  * SwapLocations
  * QuadTreeHeatMap
* input_file (string): The dataset to be anonymized
* output_folder (string, optional): Folder to save the generated output datasets
* main_output_file (string. optional): The name of the anonymized dataset 
* save_preprocessed_dataset (boolean, optional): True: Export the pre-processed dataset
* preprocessed_file (string, optional): The name of the pre-processed dataset

Each of the anonymization methods has some specific parameters that have to be added to the parameters file:
* SwapMob:
  * spatial_thold (float): Maximum distance (in km) to consider two locations as close
  * temporal_thold (int): Maximum time difference (in seconds) to consider two locations as coexistent 
  * min_n_swap (int, optional): Minimum number of swaps for a trajectory for not being removed.
  * seed (int, optional): Seed for the random swapping process

Example using the given [configuration file](examples/configs/config_SwapMob.json):
```bash
python -m mob_data_anonymizer anonymize -f examples/configs/config_SwapMob.json
```

* Microaggregation:
  * k (int): Minimum number of trajectories to be aggregated in a cluster

Example using the given [configuration file](examples/configs/config_Microaggregation.json):
```bash
python -m mob_data_anonymizer anonymize -f examples/configs/config_Microaggregation.json
```

* SwapLocations:
  * k (int):  Minimum number of locations of the swapping cluster
  * min_r_s (int): Minimum spatial radius of the swapping cluster (in meters)
  * max_r_s (int): Maximum spatial radius for building the swapping cluster (in meters)
  * min_r_t (int): Minimum temporal threshold for building the swapping cluster (in seconds)
  * max_r_t (int): Maximum temporal threshold for building the swapping cluster (in seconds)

Example using the given [configuration file](examples/configs/config_SwapLocations.json):
```bash
python -m mob_data_anonymizer anonymize -f examples/configs/config_SwapLocations.json
```

* QuadTreeHeatMap:
  * min_k (int): Minimum number of locations allowed co-exist in a QuadTree sector.
  The algorithm ensures K-anonymity using this k.
  * min_sector_length (int): Minimum side length (in meters) for a QuadTree sector.
  Equivalent to minimum resolution.
  Due to the definition of the tree depth, empirical min_sector_length can be almost two times greater.
  * merge_sectors (bool): If True, sectors with an insufficient number of locations will be merged with neighboring sectors.
  This always preserves or enhances utility.
  * split_n_locations (int): Maximum number of locations allowed in a QuadTree sector before it is split into 4 subsectors.
  It must be greater than min_k. If lower or None, the value would be automatically set to min_k.
  A value of min_k is expected to be the bests in terms of utility.

Example using the given [configuration file](examples/configs/config_QuadTreeHeatMap.json):
```bash
python -m mob_data_anonymizer analysis -f examples/configs/config_QuadTreeHeatMap.json
```

#### Utility metrics
As previously mentioned, the anonymization module also includes a tool to compute and compare some utility metrics of original and anonymized datasets. We leverage on the well-known scikit-mobility library to compute these utility metrics. To compute some of these measures, the datasets to be compared are previously tessellated.

Again, the parameter values to compute the measures are provided to the application through a JSON file:
```bash
python â€“m mob_data_anonymizer measures -f parameters_file.json 
```
Available parameters are:
* method (array): The name of the measures to compute. Must be some of the following (please, visit the [scikit-mobility website](https://scikit-mobility.github.io/scikit-mobility/reference/measures.html) for details):
  * visits_per_location
  * distance_straight_line
  * uncorrelated_location_entropy
  * random_location_entropy
  * mean_square_displacement
* mode (string): Type of output. As some measures output is a DataFrame a strategy has to be defined. Must be one of the following:
  * average: computes the average of each DataFrame (from original and anonymized dataset) and send it to stdout
  * export: join and export both output DataFrame (from the original and anonymized datasets) to a single CSV file
* input_1 (string): Filepath of the first dataset 
* input_2 (string): Filepath of the second dataset 
* output_folder (string, optional): Folder to save the generated output files

Example using the given [configuration file](examples/configs/config_metrics.json):
```bash
python -m mob_data_anonymizer measures -f examples/configs/config_metrics.json
```

### API

### As a library
Once the module is installed, its usage only requires an import:
```python
import mob_data_anonymizer
```
An example using all the aforementioned anonymization methods is provided in the [examples/anonymize/src/main.py](examples/anonymize/src/main.py) file.
